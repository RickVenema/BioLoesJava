# BioLoesJava

## Introduction
This is BioLoesJava, a java version of my personal library BioLoes. This project is currently in its early
stages, and is currently being worked on. The BioLoes library project was initialy started in April 2018 after 
my cat has passed, therefore the name choice for me was an easy task. Her name was Loes, and with this library (and 
the other BioLoes libraries in other languages) project I wanted to sustain the memories I have with her. So in April 2018
BioLoes was born.
